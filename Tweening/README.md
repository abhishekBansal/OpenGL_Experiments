Tweening
==================

A simple tweening example in OpenGL
Its a CMake based project having dependancies on Freeglut.
CMake i just added for learning purpose, for this small project its an over kill
so just feel free to create a VS project and setup libraries by yourself in solution in case you want to build.
Otherwise install CMake and Modify paths in Env.bat file as per your setup and generate a VS solution.

Ideally it should work on linux also but i haven't tested :)
