Terrain Generator
==================

A Terrain Generator/Visualizer based on algorithms taught on LightHouse3D.com(After making this i got to know they also have one and thats better :-/). 
This again is CMake based project but go ahead and create a VS solution if you find it complex. Its tested on VS 2008(There are compilation issues with GLUI on higher versions)

Library Dependancies:
1. GLUI (http://glui.sourceforge.net/)(It Requires GLUT and NOT freeglut)
2. GLUT
3. OpenCV
4. TBB (My OpenCV was built with TBB so dll was required)

Ideally it should work on linux also but i haven't tested :)
