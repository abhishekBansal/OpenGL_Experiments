GLSL RayTracer
==================

A Simple Raytracer based on GLSL. Its not working as I expected spheres are not properly visible from all camera angles 
and I dont know why textures are not working in blinn-phong at all. As far as i remember everything was working when i left it in college. :-/
I spent sometime in debugging but couldn't find anything :(. Will see sometime later. Demo video below shows properly working version.

Library Dependancies:
---------------------
1. GLUI (http://glui.sourceforge.net/)(It Requires GLUT and NOT freeglut)
2. GLUT
3. OpenCV
4. TBB (My OpenCV was built with TBB so dll was required)
5. GLEW

Ideally it should work on linux also but i haven't tested :)
