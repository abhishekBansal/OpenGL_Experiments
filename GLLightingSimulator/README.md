GLLightingSimulator
====================
A Lighting Simulator in OpenGL and GLSL. Every lighting parameter has been linked with GUI so that its easier to determine color/material of a object in any OpenGL based project, also it can help in understanding how different parameters affect lighting.

Library Dependancies:
---------------------
1. GLUT
2. GLUI
3. GLEW

Tested with VS2008. There are some comiplation issues in GLUI with higher VS versions.
Ideally it should work on linux also but i haven't tested :)
